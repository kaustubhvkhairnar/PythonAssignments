#3.Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
#contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
#should filter out all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to
#90. Map function will increase each number by 10. Reduce will return product of all that
#numbers.
